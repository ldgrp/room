## Poem

> Spaces are more than just a place,  
> They're extensions of ourselves, a reflection of our grace.  
> They offer comfort and safety, a place to call our own,  
> A sanctuary for our souls, a space that we have grown.
>
> A bedroom is one such space, a place of rest and peace,  
> A place where we recharge our souls, where our worries cease.  
> It's where we dream and imagine, and where we find reprieve,  
> A place where we can truly be ourselves, where we can truly breathe.
>
> This bedroom that I've created is a tribute to such spaces,  
> A reminder to cherish them, to hold on to their traces.  
> Whether it's a childhood home or a first apartment,  
> These spaces hold a special place in our hearts, an indelible imprint.
>
> So let's hold onto these spaces, these moments that define,  
> The memories and emotions that are uniquely mine.  
> And as we move on to new places, let's remember to hold true,  
> To the spaces that shaped us, the spaces that made us anew.
